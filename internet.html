    How the internet works
  </div>

  <div class="boxed-text-right">
    The Internet is a worldwide computer network based on a standard communication protocol: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP / IP). Many smaller networks have been built over the years and are linked to one another in a large, worldwide network. Although there are also isolated networks that use the same technology, this global network is now called the Internet.
    The use of these protocol’s allows computers to communicate across a variety of physical networks such as cable, fiber, radio link, satellite, and wireless network, and is the basis for computers to communicate across the world.
    The most widespread uses of the Internet are the Web - for gathering and delivering information in many forms, Gaming – playing with each other over vast distances. and email - for sending messages to other people.
    The Internet has no single owner. The Internet is an interconnection of several networks that are built and operated by telecommunications companies and specialized ISPs. As a user of the Internet, you often purchase a PC and subscribe to a service provider, often called the ISP (Internet Service Provider). The PC is connected to the telecommunications network and set to communicate with the service provider's server machine which conveys the transmission further, before returning what you want back to you.
